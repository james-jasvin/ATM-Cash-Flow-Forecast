# ATM Cash Flow Forecast
This is a publicly available dataset forked from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/nittha/atm-data-m2), in it we have lots of data about the per day operation of an ATM like Day of Week, Working/Holiday, etc. with the key attribute being the amount withdrawn from the ATM on that day.
The task is to predict the amount that will be withdrawn for a day provided the input features are given.
Currently, have implemented KNN Regression for prediction with Root Mean Square Error of approx. 187000
